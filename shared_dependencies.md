Shared Dependencies:

1. **HTML Files**: All HTML files (index.html, prompts.html, search.html, categories.html, upload.html) will share the same basic structure including the DOCTYPE declaration, html, head, and body tags. They will also share the same link to the CSS files (styles.css and tailwind.css) and the JavaScript file (scripts.js).

2. **CSS Files**: The styles.css and tailwind.css files will be shared across all HTML files for consistent styling. The Tailwind CSS file will provide utility classes that can be used in the HTML files.

3. **JavaScript File**: The scripts.js file will contain all the JavaScript functions that will be used across the HTML files. This includes functions for uploading, searching, and categorizing prompts.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The JavaScript functions will interact with various DOM elements across the HTML files. Some of these IDs might include "uploadForm" for the form used to upload prompts, "searchInput" for the search bar, "categoryList" for the list of categories, and "promptContainer" for the area where prompts are displayed.

5. **Data Schemas**: The data schema for the prompts might include fields like "id", "content", "category", and "dateUploaded". This schema will be used in the JavaScript functions and in the HTML templates for displaying prompts.

6. **Function Names**: Some function names that might be shared across the HTML files include "uploadPrompt()", "searchPrompts()", "categorizePrompt()", and "copyPrompt()". These functions will be defined in the scripts.js file and called from the HTML files.

7. **Message Names**: Message names might include "uploadSuccess", "uploadFailure", "searchNoResults", and "copySuccess". These would be used in the JavaScript functions to display feedback to the user.
